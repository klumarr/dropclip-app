TESTING

Perfect! All our test data is now set up correctly. Here's a summary of what we've created and verified:
Users (dev-users):
Creative: test-creative-1 ✓
Fan: test-fan-1 ✓
Events (dev-events):
Event 1: test-event-1 (Jan 15, 2025) ✓
Event 2: test-event-2 (Jan 20, 2025) ✓
Follow Relationship (dev-follows):
Fan test-fan-1 following Creative test-creative-1 ✓
Attendance (dev-attendance):
Fan test-fan-1 attending Event 1 test-event-1 ✓
Now we're ready to start testing the Fan Flow. Here's what we'll test in order:
Fan Flow Testing:
// Test Scenario 1: View Events

- Fan can see both events
- Fan can see attendance status for Event 1
- Fan can see they're following the creative

// Test Scenario 2: Upload Access

- Fan can access upload for Event 1 (attended)
- Fan cannot access upload for Event 2 (not attended)

// Test Scenario 3: Upload Process

- Fan can upload video to Event 1
- Fan can see upload status
- Fan receives notifications

Great! Both users are now created in Cognito. Here are the login details for testing:
Fan User:
Email: test.fan@example.com
Temporary Password: Welcome123!
New Password: Tester123!
Creative User:
Email: test.creative@example.com
Temporary Password: Welcome123!

Important Notes:
On first login, both users will be required to change their passwords (UserStatus: FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD)
The fan user's Cognito ID is: f05c69fc-4081-70fe-233e-45f3fcb8ffac
The creative user's Cognito ID is: 70fcc92c-1001-70c9-5b1c-8ea7d995aab6

Perfect! Everything is now set up for testing. Here's what you can do to test Scenario 1:
Login Steps:

1.  Go to the app URL
2.  Click "Sign In"
3.  Enter fan credentials:
    Email: test.fan@example.com
    Temp Password: Welcome123!
4.  You'll be prompted to create a new password
    After Login, You Should See:

- Both test events (Jan 15 and Jan 20)
- "Attending" status on Event 1 (Jan 15)
- "Following" status for the creative
  Expected Test Results:
  ✓ Event List shows both events
  ✓ Event 1 shows "Attending" status
  ✓ Event 2 shows no attendance status
  ✓ Creative's profile shows "Following" status
  Would you like me to:
  Provide the app URL for testing?
  Help set up any additional test data?
  Walk through the testing process step by step?
  Also, I recommend taking screenshots during testing to document the results. This will help us track any UI/UX issues that need to be addressed.
