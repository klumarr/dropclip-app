This update reflects the current state of implementation as of the latest commit. The core infrastructure is in place, but several key components need to be implemented to complete the basic user flow. The focus should be on implementing the fan upload system and event sharing capabilities to enable the core user journey.

This document serves as both a roadmap and a reference for implementing the core user flow of DropClip. It will be updated as implementation progresses and new requirements are identified.
