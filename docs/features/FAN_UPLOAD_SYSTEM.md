# Fan Upload System Architecture

## Overview

The Fan Upload System is a critical bridge between creatives and fans, enabling secure, efficient video sharing post-event. This document outlines the architecture, user flows, and enhancement possibilities for the system.

## Core User Flow

### 1. Creative Side - Link Generation

#### Event Status Management

- Past events automatically move to "Past Events" tab
- Creative can activate upload window with configurable settings:
  - Upload window duration (e.g., 7 days)
  - Maximum uploads per fan
  - Required video metadata (date, location, etc.)
  - Video quality requirements
  - Size limits and format restrictions

#### Link Generation System

- Unique, secure link per event
- Optional: Individual links per fan for tracking
- Link expiration based on upload window
- QR code generation for easy sharing
- Integration with common sharing platforms

### 2. Fan Side - Upload Process

#### Upload Landing Page (`/events/{eventId}/upload`)

- Event details and branding
- Upload guidelines and requirements
- Drag-and-drop upload zone
- Multiple file selection support
- Upload queue management
- Progress tracking per file
- Upload status dashboard

#### Upload Management Dashboard (`/fan/uploads`)

- List of all uploads across events
- Upload status tracking
- Delete/replace options
- Sorting by event/date
- Filter by status
- Search functionality

### 3. Creative Side - Video Management

#### Video Management Center (`/creative/events/{eventId}/videos`)

- Grid/list view of all uploads
- Sorting by metadata (date, rating, etc.)
- Filtering options (reviewed, unreviewed, etc.)
- Batch operations
- Integration with video player
- Playlist creation tools
