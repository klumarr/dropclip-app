EVENT_PREVIEW_PAGE_MVP.md

Based on the documentation, I can suggest a better design for the event preview page that aligns with the app's goals. Here's what I recommend:

For Non-App Users (Public Preview):

1. Essential Event Information
   Event title and description
   Date and time
   Venue and location
   Event flyer/image with proper styling
   Event type/category
2. Call-to-Action Section
   "Join DropClip" button - prominent placement
   Brief value proposition explaining benefits of joining
   "Download App" button (when mobile app is ready)
3. Social Proof Elements
   Number of fans attending (if above a threshold)
   Creative's name with verified badge (if applicable)
   Preview of past event highlights (if available)
4. Limited Actions
   Share button (basic sharing options only)
   "Get Tickets" link (if tickets are available)
   Save to calendar option

Real-life Example:
Think of how Eventbrite shows public event pages - they display essential info but reserve key features for logged-in users. Or how Instagram shows limited post previews to non-users while prompting them to sign up.

For Existing Non-Followers:

1. All Public Preview Features +
2. Enhanced Engagement Options
   "Follow Creative" button
   "Interested" button
   Full sharing options
   Add to favorites
3. Additional Information
   More event details
   Related events by the same creative
   Similar events in the area

For Followers:

1. All Previous Features +
2. Full Access
   RSVP functionality
   Full sharing capabilities
   Access to exclusive content
   Early access to ticket sales (if applicable)
   Upload capability (if attended)
   The design should follow a progressive disclosure pattern:
3. Show basic info to everyone
4. Prompt non-users to join with clear benefits
5. Encourage non-followers to follow the creative
6. Provide full features to followers

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any of these changes to the preview page?

I'll analyze the event preview page requirements and create a strategic roadmap, building on our recent updates and existing functionality.

ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE:

1. We have working event sharing functionality in the creative events page
2. Event cards and styling have been consolidated
3. The link generation system is functional
4. We have authentication context and user state management

STRATEGIC ROADMAP:
