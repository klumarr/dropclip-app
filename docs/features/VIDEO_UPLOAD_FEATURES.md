# Video Upload Features Enhancement Plan

## Core Purpose Alignment

The video upload system serves as a key component for creatives to:

1. Store personal videos in their cloud space
2. Organize content for future documentaries/projects
3. Build a professional content library
4. Share selected content with their audience

## Current Features

- Basic video upload functionality
- Progress tracking
- File type validation
- Cloud storage integration
- Secure upload handling

## Proposed MVP Enhancements

### 1. Upload Experience

- Drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback
- Multi-file upload support
- File size validation and warnings
- Thumbnail preview before upload
- Upload queue management
- Pause/Resume functionality
- Retry failed uploads automatically

### 2. Video Organization

- Custom folder creation and management
- Bulk file operations (move, delete, rename)
- Smart tagging system for easy categorization
- Search functionality by name, date, tags
- Sort options (date, size, name, type)
- Grid/List view toggle

### 3. Video Processing

- Automatic video compression options
- Resolution selection before upload
- Format conversion capabilities
- Thumbnail generation
- Basic trimming functionality
- Watermark addition option

### 4. Storage Management

- Storage space indicator
- Storage tier information
- Usage analytics
- Cleanup recommendations
- Archive functionality

I'll analyze the VideoUploadPage.tsx to check if features 3 (video processing) and 4 (storage management) are properly implemented.
Let me break down what I see:
Feature 3 - Video Processing:
✅ Implemented:
Video processing options UI with resolution, format, and compression settings
Watermark text option
Processing status indicators during upload
Integration with videoProcessingService for handling video processing
Feature 4 - Storage Management:
✅ Implemented:
Storage quota display showing used and total space
Storage usage progress bar
Cleanup recommendations when storage is running low (>80% used)
Ability to archive individual files or bulk archive
File size formatting and display
Integration with storageService for quota management
Both features appear to be complete and properly integrated. The code includes:
Proper error handling
Loading states
User feedback mechanisms
Integration with necessary services
To verify everything is working as expected, you can test by:
Uploading a video and checking:
Processing options are applied
Progress indicators work
Final video format matches selected options
Testing storage management by:
Checking if storage quota is displayed correctly
Verifying cleanup recommendations appear when storage is >80% full
Testing the archive functionality for both individual and bulk files

Would you like me to help you test any specific aspect of these features?
