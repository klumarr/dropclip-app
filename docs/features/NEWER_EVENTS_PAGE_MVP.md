## Development Approach

### 1. Component Structure

```typescript
src / pages / creative / EventsPage / index.tsx; // Main container
components / EventList.tsx; // Simple list view
EventCard.tsx; // Basic card
CreateEventForm.tsx; // Simple form
EventActions.tsx; // Basic actions
```

### 2. Implementation Steps

1. **Basic List View (2-3 hours)**

   - Create EventList component
   - Implement basic mapping
   - Add loading state
   - Handle errors
   - Test data flow

2. **Event Card (2-3 hours)**

   - Build basic card layout
   - Display essential data
   - Add action buttons
   - Implement error states
   - Test interactions

3. **Create/Edit (3-4 hours)**
   - Build simple form
   - Add validation
   - Implement submission
   - Handle responses
   - Test full flow

### 3. Testing Strategy

1. **Functionality Testing**

   - Event display
   - Data accuracy
   - CRUD operations
   - Error handling
   - Loading states

2. **User Flow Testing**
   - Create event
   - View events
   - Edit event
   - Delete event
   - Handle errors

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1

- Events display correctly
- Data is accurate
- Basic actions work
- Errors are handled
- Loading states function

### Phase 2

- CRUD operations work
- Form validation functions
- Updates are reflected
- Error recovery works
- State management is solid

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**

   - Remove existing card/tab components
   - Start with basic list view
   - Implement simple event cards
   - Test data flow
   - Verify CRUD operations

2. **Short-term**
   - Add basic styling
   - Implement sorting
   - Add simple filters
   - Enhance error handling
   - Improve loading states

## Notes

- Focus on functionality over aesthetics initially
- Test thoroughly at each step
- Keep components simple and focused
- Maintain clear error handling
- Document all API interactions
- Verify data flow frequently

## Development Rules

1. No component reuse from previous implementation
2. Start with minimal styling
3. Focus on data accuracy
4. Test frequently
5. Document thoroughly
6. Keep it simple
