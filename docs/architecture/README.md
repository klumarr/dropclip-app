# DropClip Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design of the DropClip application.

## System Overview

DropClip is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript, utilizing AWS services for backend functionality. The application follows a modern, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- React 18.2.0
- TypeScript 5.3
- Material-UI v5
- React Router v6
- ESLint for code quality

### Backend Services

- AWS S3 for storage
- AWS CloudFront for content delivery
- AWS Cognito for authentication
- PostgreSQL for database

### Development Infrastructure

- Jest with TestType for testing
- ESLint for code quality
- AWS SDK for service integration
- Video processing pipeline

## Component Structure

The application follows a modular component structure:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── layout/         # Layout components
│   ├── features/       # Feature-specific components
│   └── video/          # Video-related components
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── services/           # API and service integrations
├── store/              # State management
├── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
└── utils/              # Utility functions
```

## Data Flow

1. **User Interface Layer**

   - React components
   - Material-UI components
   - Custom hooks for state management

2. **Application Layer**

   - Business logic
   - State management
   - API integration

3. **Service Layer**

   - AWS service integration
   - Database operations
   - Authentication

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - AWS S3 storage
   - CloudFront CDN
   - PostgreSQL database

## Authentication Flow

1. User initiates sign-in
2. AWS Cognito handles authentication
3. JWT tokens are managed securely
4. Protected routes are enforced

## Video Processing Pipeline

1. Video upload to S3
2. Processing queue management
3. Transcoding and optimization
4. CDN distribution

## Security Considerations

- JWT token management
- AWS IAM roles and policies
- CORS configuration
- API Gateway security

## Performance Optimization

- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- CDN caching
- Image and video optimization

## Monitoring and Logging

- AWS CloudWatch integration
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**

   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load balancing
   - Cache optimization

2. **Feature Expansion**

   - Additional video processing features
   - Enhanced social features
   - Analytics dashboard

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Multi-region deployment
   - Backup and recovery
   - Disaster recovery plan

## Authentication Types

Creating auth types file with necessary interfaces.
