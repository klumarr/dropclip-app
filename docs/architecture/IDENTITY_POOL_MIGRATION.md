# DropClip Identity Pool Migration Plan - 9th January 2025 LATEST PLAN!!

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step migration plan for implementing AWS Cognito Identity Pool authentication in the DropClip application while preserving current functionality and UI/UX.

## Prerequisites (✅ Completed)

- Identity Pool "dropclip-identity" created in eu-north-1
- IAM roles configured:
  - dropclip-fan-role
  - dropclip-creative-role
  - Supporting service roles

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: AWS Client Configuration Layer

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk Level**: Low
**Rollback Impact**: Minimal

#### Tasks

1. Create New AWS Client Configuration

   ```typescript
   // src/aws-config.ts
   - Keep existing configuration
   - Add Identity Pool integration
   - Implement credential refresh logic
   ```

2. Service Client Factory

   ```typescript
   // src/services/aws-client.factory.ts
   - Implement credential provider
   - Add service client creation methods
   - Add error handling and retry logic
   ```

3. Testing Points
   - Verify credential generation
   - Test token refresh flow
   - Validate error handling

### Phase 2: Service Migration

**Strategy**: One service at a time, with fallback support

#### 2.1 Authentication Service Migration

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Rollback Impact**: Low

Tasks:

1. Update Auth Context

   - Keep Firebase auth
   - Add Cognito identity integration
   - Implement token exchange

2. Testing Requirements
   - Login flow
   - Token refresh
   - Session persistence
   - Error scenarios

#### 2.2 Storage/Upload Services Migration

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Rollback Impact**: Medium

Tasks:

1. S3 Client Updates

   - Implement new client with Identity Pool credentials
   - Update upload methods
   - Add progress tracking
   - Error handling

2. Testing Requirements
   - File uploads
   - Progress tracking
   - Error scenarios
   - Large file handling

#### 2.3 Event Services Migration

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Rollback Impact**: Medium

Tasks:

1. DynamoDB Access Updates

   - Implement new client
   - Update query methods
   - Add pagination support
   - Error handling

2. Testing Requirements
   - Event creation
   - Event fetching
   - Pagination
   - Error scenarios

Perfect! Our tests confirm that the Event Services migration is complete and working correctly. Let's summarize what we've verified:
✅ Read Operations
Successfully retrieved individual event using getEvent
Successfully listed all events for a creative using listCreativeEvents
Data structure matches our Event interface
✅ Write Operations
Successfully created new event
All required fields are properly stored
Timestamps are correctly formatted
Event appears in subsequent queries
✅ Data Integrity
All three test events are present
All fields are properly formatted
Indexes (dateId, dateCreativeId) are working
Consistent data structure across all events
✅ Performance
Scan operation shows reasonable performance (18 items scanned)
No errors or timeouts in operations

TESTING FAN EVENT VIEWING FUNCTIONALITY
The fan event viewing functionality is now complete and working correctly. To summarize what we've verified:
Database Structure:
Events table has proper public/private visibility control
Follows table tracks fan-creative relationships
Event data includes all necessary fields
Access Control:
Fans can only see events from creatives they follow
Events must be marked as public to be visible
Authentication is required to view events
Event Categorization:
Events are properly sorted into upcoming/past based on date
We have test events in both categories
Date handling is working correctly
Test Data:
Follow relationship: test-fan-1 → test-creative-1
Public events:
2 upcoming events (Feb & Mar 2025)
1 past event (Jan 2024)
Would you like to test any other aspects of the fan event viewing functionality?

TO TEST IN APP

Now that we've updated the service to properly filter for public events, let's test the fan event viewing functionality in the app. Here's what we should test:
Authentication Flow:
Sign in as a fan user
Verify the authentication state is properly handled
Check that unauthenticated users see the correct message
Event Loading:
Verify loading states are shown
Check that events are properly categorized into upcoming/past
Confirm error handling works
Event Display:
Verify event cards show all required information
Check that images load correctly
Test share functionality
Verify past events show video/upload options
UI/UX:
Test mobile responsiveness
Verify tab switching works
Check empty state messages
Test error state displays

Would you like me to help you test any specific aspect of these, or would you prefer to see the complete test plan with specific steps for each area?
