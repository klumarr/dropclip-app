# DropClip Application Architecture

## Overview

DropClip is a web application that enables video upload, processing, and management using a modern serverless architecture. The application is split into frontend (browser) and backend (AWS Lambda) components, working together to provide a seamless user experience.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Frontend (Browser) Architecture

```
src/
├── components/     → Reusable UI components
├── pages/         → Route-specific pages
├── services/      → Frontend services that talk to AWS
└── types/         → TypeScript type definitions
```

**Key Components:**

- **React UI**: Built with React 18.2.0 and TypeScript 5.3
- **Material-UI**: Uses MUI v5 for consistent, modern UI components
- **AWS SDK**: Browser-side AWS service integration
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for state
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for navigation
- **File Handling**: React-dropzone for file uploads

**Frontend Responsibilities:**

- User interface rendering and interactions
- File upload management
- Real-time status updates
- AWS service communication
- Authentication state management
- Client-side validation

### 2. Backend (Lambda) Architecture

```
src/lambda/
└── content-processor/  → Video processing Lambda function
    └── index.js       → Handles video uploads, thumbnails, etc.
```

**Key Components:**

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for video processing
- **Node.js Runtime**: Server-side JavaScript execution
- **AWS Services Integration**: S3, DynamoDB, CloudFront
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg for video transcoding
- **Security**: IAM roles and policies

**Backend Responsibilities:**

- Video processing and transcoding
- Thumbnail generation
- Metadata extraction
- Database operations
- Security enforcement
- AWS service orchestration

## Application Flows

### 1. User Upload Flow

```
Browser → Frontend Code → AWS S3 → Lambda → DynamoDB
   |         |             |         |          |
   User    React UI     Storage   Process    Database
```

**Process Steps:**

1. User selects video file through UI
2. Frontend validates file (size, type)
3. Direct upload to S3 begins
4. S3 triggers Lambda function
5. Lambda processes video
6. Database updated with status
7. UI reflects completion

### 2. Data Flow

```
Frontend (Browser)                 Backend (Lambda)
┌──────────────────┐              ┌──────────────────┐
│  React App       │  API Calls   │  Lambda Function │
│  - UI Components │ ────────────>│  - Processing    │
│  - AWS SDK       │              │  - AWS Services  │
└──────────────────┘              └──────────────────┘
        │                                  │
        │                                  │
        ▼                                  ▼
   User Interface                      AWS Services
   (Browser)                    (S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
```

**Data Flow Patterns:**

- Frontend-to-Backend: API calls, file uploads
- Backend-to-Frontend: Status updates, processed data
- Service-to-Service: AWS service communications
- Database Operations: CRUD operations via DynamoDB

### 3. Security & Authentication

```
User → Cognito → JWT Token → AWS Services
```

**Security Layers:**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - AWS Cognito user pools
   - JWT token management
   - Secure session handling

2. **Authorization:**

   - IAM roles and policies
   - Resource-level permissions
   - API access control

3. **Data Security:**
   - HTTPS encryption
   - S3 bucket policies
   - Lambda security groups

### 4. Video Processing Pipeline

```
Upload → S3 → Lambda → Processing Steps → Final Storage
   |      |      |           |                |
Browser  Store Trigger  - Transcode      S3 + DynamoDB
                       - Thumbnail
                       - Metadata
```

**Processing Steps:**

1. **Upload Reception:**

   - File received in S3
   - Event triggered
   - Lambda invoked

2. **Processing:**

   - Video transcoding
   - Thumbnail generation
   - Metadata extraction
   - Quality checks

3. **Storage:**
   - Processed files to S3
   - Metadata to DynamoDB
   - CDN distribution

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Scalability:**

   - Automatic Lambda scaling
   - S3 unlimited storage
   - DynamoDB on-demand capacity

2. **Cost-Effectiveness:**

   - Pay-per-use model
   - No idle server costs
   - Optimized resource usage

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
