# DropClip Development Handover Brief - January 9th, 2025 (v2)

## Project Overview

DropClip is a video-sharing platform connecting performers/artists with their fans for event video sharing and management. The platform enables fans to share event recordings directly with artists while allowing artists to manage and showcase this content.

## Current Project Status

We are implementing three major features simultaneously:

### 1. Identity Pool Migration (âœ… COMPLETED)

- Successfully migrated from direct AWS credentials to Identity Pool
- Implemented proper role-based access (fan/creative roles)
- Enhanced security with temporary credentials
- Added comprehensive error handling

### 2. Event Management System (ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS)

- Implemented follow-based event visibility
- Enhanced event filtering and categorization
- Added comprehensive event testing
- Improved event data persistence

### 3. Video Processing Pipeline (ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS)

Currently implementing:

- Cancel processing functionality
- Enhanced error handling
- Progress tracking
- Improved user feedback

## Active Development Areas

### Current Focus

1. Addressing linter errors in:

   - `EventsContext.tsx` - EventFormData type compatibility issues
   - `video.service.ts` - UploadItem type property issues

2. Enhancing video processing:
   - Implementing cancellation
   - Adding progress tracking
   - Improving error handling

### Type System Updates

Working on resolving type incompatibilities:

- EventFormData vs Event types
- UploadItem properties
- Status enums

   - Event management context
   - State management
   - Event operations

6. src/services/video.service.ts
   - Video processing service
   - AWS Lambda integration
   - Processing status management

7. src/services/lambda.service.ts
   - AWS Lambda integration
   - Function invocation
   - Error handling

8. lambda/cancel-processing/index.js
   - Processing cancellation
   - Status updates
   - Resource cleanup
```

### Type Definitions

```typescript
9. src/types/uploads.ts
   - Upload type definitions
   - Status enums
   - Metadata types

10. src/types/events.ts
    - Event type definitions
    - Form data types
    - State types

11. src/types/auth.ts
    - Authentication types
    - User roles
    - Session management
```

## Technical Environment

### Core Technologies

- React 18.2.0
- TypeScript 5.3
- Material-UI v5
- AWS SDK v3
- Node.js 18.19.0

### AWS Services in Use

- Cognito Identity Pool
- DynamoDB
- S3
- CloudFront
- Lambda
- API Gateway

## Current Issues

### Type System

1. EventsContext:

   - Missing properties in EventFormData
   - Incompatible types in event creation
   - Partial type mismatches

2. Video Service:
   - Missing UploadItem properties
   - Status enum incompatibilities
   - Type definition gaps

### Implementation

1. Video Processing:

   - Cancellation implementation incomplete
   - Progress tracking needs enhancement
   - Error handling improvements needed

2. Mobile Experience:
   - Responsiveness issues
   - Loading state improvements needed
   - Better error feedback required

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Fix type definitions in `src/types/uploads.ts`
2. Update EventFormData initialization
3. Complete video processing cancellation
4. Enhance error handling

### Short-term Goals

1. Complete video processing pipeline
2. Add comprehensive testing
3. Improve user feedback
4. Enhance mobile experience

### Medium-term Goals

1. Implement batch operations
2. Add analytics tracking
3. Enhance mobile experience
4. Implement offline support

## Testing Requirements

### Authentication Flow

- Test both user types (fan/creative)
- Verify role assignment
- Check token refresh
- Test error scenarios

### Video Processing

- Upload functionality
- Processing status updates
- Cancellation feature
- Error handling
- Progress tracking

### Event Management

- Follow-based visibility
- Event filtering
- Data persistence
- Access control

## Recent Changes (v1.6.0 - January 9th, 2025)

- Implemented AWS Cognito Identity Pool integration
- Added secure role-based access control
- Enhanced user session management
- Improved authentication flow reliability
- Added comprehensive error handling

## Project Architecture

### Frontend

- React with TypeScript
