# DropClip Handover Brief - January 15, 2025 (V2)

## Current Status Overview

We are currently working on fixing TypeScript errors in the event management system, specifically focusing on image upload functionality and form handling. The main issues revolve around proper typing of event handlers and ensuring correct state management for image uploads.

## Active Issues

1. TypeScript Errors in EventDetailsForm:

   - Type 'void' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode' in Grid and Box components
   - Issues with console.log statements in JSX
   - Event handler return type mismatches

2. Image Upload Flow:
   - Successfully uploading to S3
   - CloudFront URL generation working
   - Image preview functionality needs type fixes
   - State management between components needs review

## Key Components and Files

### Core Components

1. `src/components/events/creative/EventDetailsForm/index.tsx`

   - Main form component for event details
   - Handles image upload UI and state
   - Currently experiencing TypeScript errors

2. `src/hooks/useImageUpload.ts`

   - Custom hook for image upload functionality
   - Manages upload state and progress
   - Integrates with S3 and CloudFront services

3. `src/services/s3.service.ts`

   - Handles S3 operations
   - File upload and URL generation
   - Recently updated to use CloudFront URLs

4. `src/contexts/StorageContext.tsx`
   - Provides storage-related functionality
   - Manages quotas and analytics
   - Coordinates between S3 and CloudFront

### Supporting Files

1. `src/services/cloudfront.service.ts`

   - CloudFront URL generation
   - Cache invalidation
   - Distribution management

2. `src/types/events.ts`
   - Event-related type definitions
   - Form data interfaces
   - Validation types

## Current Implementation Details

### Image Upload Flow

1. User selects image in EventDetailsForm
2. useImageUpload hook processes the file:
   - Uploads to S3
   - Generates CloudFront URL
   - Updates form state
3. Preview is displayed using CloudFront URL
4. State is managed through form handlers

### TypeScript Fixes Required

1. Event Handler Types:

   ```typescript
   // Current issue
   onClick={() => setIsImageExpanded(true)}

   // Needs to be
   onClick={() => {
     setIsImageExpanded(true);
     return undefined;
   }}
   ```

2. Console.log in JSX:
   - Need to handle void return types
   - Consider moving logs outside JSX or using useEffect

## Next Steps

1. Fix TypeScript errors in EventDetailsForm:

   - Update event handler return types
   - Resolve console.log issues in JSX
   - Ensure proper typing for all callbacks

2. Verify image upload flow:

   - Test complete upload process
   - Verify preview functionality
   - Check state management

3. Code cleanup:
   - Remove redundant console.logs
   - Optimize event handlers
   - Add proper error boundaries

## Files to Scan for Context

```typescript
// Primary Components
src / components / events / creative / EventDetailsForm / index.tsx;
src / hooks / useImageUpload.ts;
src / services / s3.service.ts;
src / contexts / StorageContext.tsx;

// Supporting Files
src / services / cloudfront.service.ts;
src / types / events.ts;
src / components / events / creative / CreateEventDialog / index.tsx;
src / components / events / creative / EditEventDialog / index.tsx;

// Configuration
src / config / amplify - config.ts.env.development;
```

## Recent Changes

1. Updated S3 service to use CloudFront URLs:

   - Modified getSignedUrl
   - Updated getDownloadUrl
   - Added proper error handling

2. Enhanced EventDetailsForm:
   - Added explicit return types
   - Improved error handling
   - Updated image preview logic

## Known Issues

1. TypeScript errors in EventDetailsForm component
2. Console.log statements causing type conflicts
3. Event handler return type mismatches

## Testing Instructions

1. Image Upload:

   - Upload new image
   - Verify preview displays
   - Check console for proper logging
   - Verify CloudFront URL generation

2. Form Validation:
   - Test all required fields
   - Verify error states
   - Check image removal functionality

## Additional Notes

- All AWS configurations (S3, CloudFront) are properly set up
- CORS and bucket policies are configured correctly
- Environment variables are properly set in development
