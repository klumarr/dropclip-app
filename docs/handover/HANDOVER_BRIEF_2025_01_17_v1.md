## AWS Integration Status

- Using AWS Cognito for authentication
- DynamoDB for event storage
- S3 for file storage
- CloudFront for content delivery

## Authentication Flow

Currently transitioning from Firebase to AWS Cognito:

- Removed Firebase dependencies
- Implementing Cognito authentication
- Updating protected routes
- Handling authentication state

## Next Steps

1. Complete missing method implementations in `eventsService.ts`
2. Fix layout issues with MainLayout integration
3. Implement proper error handling and loading states

4. Include console logs for debugging
5. Update documentation as changes are made

## Testing Requirements

1. Test authentication flow
2. Verify event save/unsave functionality
3. Check profile page navigation
4. Validate upcoming events display
5. Test responsive layout

## Additional Notes
