# Fan Upload System - MVP Implementation

## Core Requirements

- Fans must follow creative
- Fans must mark event as "attended"
- All attendees get 10 video upload limit
- Automatic link generation upon meeting requirements

## Workflow Structure

### Creative Side Workflow

1. Event Creation & Setup

   ```typescript
   interface EventUploadSettings {
     autoGenerateLinks: boolean; // Always true in MVP
     uploadLimit: number; // Fixed at 10 for MVP
     allowedFileTypes: string[]; // MP4, MOV, M4V
     maxFileSize: number; // 500MB per video
     requireFollowers: boolean; // Always true in MVP
   }
   ```

2. Post-Event Flow

   - Event automatically transitions to "collecting memories" state
   - System tracks:
     - Fans who marked attendance
     - Follow status of attendees
     - Generated upload links
     - Upload progress

3. Content Management Flow
   ```typescript
   interface ContentManagement {
     viewUploads: {
       byFan: string[]; // Group by uploader
       byDate: string[]; // Chronological order
       byStatus: string[]; // Processing/Complete
     };
     moderationActions: {
       removeContent: boolean; // Basic content removal
       blockUser: boolean; // Block problematic users
     };
   }
   ```

### Fan Side Workflow

1. Event Participation Flow

   ```typescript
   interface FanParticipation {
     prerequisites: {
       followCreative: boolean; // Must follow creative
       markAttended: boolean; // Must mark as attended
     };
     actions: {
       findEvent: string; // Event discovery
       followCreative: boolean; // Follow action
       markAttendance: boolean; // Attendance marking
     };
   }
   ```

2. Upload Access Flow

   ```typescript
   interface UploadAccess {
     triggerConditions: {
       isFollowing: boolean; // Check follow status
       hasMarkedAttended: boolean; // Check attendance status
     };
     linkGeneration: {
       automatic: boolean; // True when conditions met
       delivery: "in-app"; // Link delivered in app
     };
   }
   ```

3. Upload Process Flow
   ```typescript
   interface UploadProcess {
     limits: {
       totalVideos: 10; // Fixed limit
       perVideoSize: "500MB"; // Size limit
       fileTypes: ["MP4", "MOV", "M4V"];
     };
     tracking: {
       uploadsRemaining: number;
       uploadProgress: number;
       uploadStatus: string;
     };
   }
   ```

### Automatic System Actions

1. Link Generation

   ```typescript
   interface AutomaticActions {
     whenTriggered: {
       followAndAttend: "generateLink";
     };
     linkProperties: {
       unique: boolean; // One link per fan
       expiry: "none"; // No expiration in MVP
       reusable: boolean; // Can use until limit reached
     };
   }
   ```

2. Status Tracking
   ```typescript
   interface StatusTracking {
     trackUploads: {
       count: number; // Track against limit
       status: string; // Upload status
     };
     notifications: {
       uploadComplete: boolean;
       limitReached: boolean;
     };
   }
   ```

### Integration Points

1. Event System

   ```typescript
   interface EventIntegration {
     status: {
       active: "collecting-memories";
     };
     tracking: {
       attendees: string[];
       uploads: number;
     };
   }
   ```

2. User System
   ```typescript
   interface UserIntegration {
     relationships: {
       following: boolean;
       attended: string[];
     };
     uploads: {
       byEvent: Map<string, number>;
     };
   }
   ```
